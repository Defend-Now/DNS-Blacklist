## Defend Now DNS Blacklist

### ❓ What is a DNS Blacklist?

A DNS blacklist is a list of domain names or IP addresses that are associated with malicious activities, such as:
- Phishing
- Malware distribution
- Spam
- Other security threats

By using a DNS blacklist, you can prevent your devices from connecting to these harmful domains, enhancing your online security and privacy.

### ⚙️ How to use this blacklist:

1. Download the hosts.txt file: You can directly download the hosts.txt file from this repository.
2. Integrate with your system:
 Operating Systems: Most operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) have a hosts file that you can modify. Add the entries from hosts.txt to your system's hosts file.
 DNS Servers: If you run your own DNS server (like Pi-hole or AdGuard Home), you can import the hosts.txt file as a blocklist.
3. Regular Updates: This blacklist is **regularly updated**. Make sure to check for new versions to keep your system protected.
